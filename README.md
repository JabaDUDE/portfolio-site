This started off as simply a small project to create preview cards
for all of my projects I wanted to showcase on my portfolio. Once
that was done, I decided to extend it to a full-blown portfolio
site that was fully responsive and functional. It was created with
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I do intend to had a little bit more
functionality to it with javascript as well as improve the responsiveness
for larger screens in the near future.
