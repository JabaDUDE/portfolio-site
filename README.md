# My Awesome Project
My official portfolio site that showcases a little about me and the projects I'm most proud of!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I drew inspiration for this from another developer's website and loved the colors cheme. It wasn't until much later that I learned that this developer also grabbed it from somewhere else, which seemed to originate as a tutorial. But when I created it, I spent quite a bit of time dissecting this developer's website to understand the colors and text font. After that, it was a matter of bringing together the projects I wanted to showcase, the cards they'd be put in, and spacing.

## Lessons Learned:

Creating the cards was fun and challenging for several reasons.  Each component of the card had its own requirement for formatting and styling that had to be considered. I had a lot of fun playing around with the seemingly infinite possibilities and was the first time I had to use several div tags for containers.

## Examples:
